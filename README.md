Test Report

1. web element locator for About seems to be disabled. I try using different locator strategies i.e LinkText, CSS Selector, Xpath e.t.c
noon seems to work. About CTA not more responsive when clicked by selenium Driver, but responsive when clicked on manually

2. Due to the About bottom for CTA not being responsive, I completed the test by clicking on contact and fill the required field.

3. After completing the required form and submission an error message pop up on the Company section of the form "Please fill out this field".
